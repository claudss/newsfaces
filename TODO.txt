1. train a simple model on aligned-faces-matlab folder.
	-load the data into pytorch
	-try cropping within the center region
	-train SIMPLE recognition model to go through these faces
	-recall, overall positive rating, perf. ratio, impact used as target variables (see talent xlsx in dropbox)
		-output accuracy is being measured.
		-randomly split for testing purposes?
